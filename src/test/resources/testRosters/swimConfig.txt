#Outline of what a swim level config file would probably look like. 
# Top row is the order of the swim levels, from 0 up. Each row belowmaps a swim activity to the lowest swim level that can do it
# Considered spelling out each valid level for each camptivity, so it could catch cases where blue swimmers end up in lessons,
# but it doesn't sound like that could realistically happen and would add complexity to whoever's updating these
#I think .txt is best, as the top row breaks the csv format and any custom extension will just scare camp ppl away
